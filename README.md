## Proposal

### Traffic Collisions in Los Angeles

Our project seeks to uncover patterns among traffic accidents in Los Angeles (North Hollywood), utilizing traffic collision data provided by the LAPD. We will uncover patterns and correlations among location frequency, changes over time and major events type of collision in major hotspots, and present statistics, charts, maps to illustrate our results. 

Our study may be useful to city officials, planners, and engineers to design and implement infrastructural changes to reduce or eliminate future accidents.
